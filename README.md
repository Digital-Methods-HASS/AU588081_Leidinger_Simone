# AU588081_Leidinger_Simone

This repository contains the cleaned data and the script of my final project "Citizenship records in Aarhus 1740-1862 (Digital Methods: course at Aarhus Aarhus)

The original dataset from the States Archives of Aarhus can be found at: https://github.com/aarhusstadsarkiv/datasets/tree/master/citizenship/1740-1862

The data were cleaned in OpenRefine and explored in R, in order to find out more about the places of origin (oprindelsessted) and the main occupations (hovederhverv) 
people who gained citizenship in Aarhus in the chosen period had.
